Scenario: Create assessment successfully.
  Given the system administrator have the following restaurant details:
		| resto_name | min_order | delivery_fee | location 				 |
		|'Cozy Cup'	 | 200 		 | 10			| 'Tibanga, Iligan City' |
            

  When  the system administrator clicks the send button
  Then  it should have a '200' response
  
  And   it should have a field 'message' containing 'OK'
